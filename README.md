# Erwan Leboucher

Hi, I am a French software developer, currently living in Berlin, Germany. I am a passionate developer, loving to write code in JavaScript, Go and Python, along being curious about web-design and DevOps.

Enthusiast about anything related to new technologies, science or engineering, I am as well interested in motorsport, especially Formula 1 and Sci-fi.
